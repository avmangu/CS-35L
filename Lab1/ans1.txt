Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1) man-k ls

2) cp: /usr/bin/cp
   sh: /usr/bin/sh
   Shell Commands: man -k, which cp, which sh

3) . -> read / executes commands file in shell
   : -> no effect
   w -> shows who is logged in and what they are doing
   [ -> evaluate conditional tests
   X -> portable, network-transparent window system
   Shell Commands: find /usr/bin -name '?' -executable, whatis, man -k

4) The file that is actually executed is /etc/alternatives/emacs.
   Shell Commands: cd /usr/bin/, ls -l | grep emacs

5) /usr/bin/emacs version number: 24.3.1
   plain emacs version number: 25.3.1
   They are different programs because whenever Emacs is updated to a new version,
   the plain emacs is upgraded, while the Emacs program in the bin stays the same.
   This is because the old version of Emacs in the bin must remain constant in
   order to attain minimum functionality in the case of anything. 

6) g+s gives the user accessing the file group permissions.
   o-x gives only users in the file group permission to execute. 

7) find -mtime -30 -type d
   Shell Commands: man, man mtime

8) 246 symbolic links.
   Shell Commands: ls -l | grep ^l | wc

9) The oldest regular file is librom1394.so.0.3.0 (Dec 28, 2013).
   Shell Commands: ls -lt | grep ^- 
   
10) The locale command gets its data from environment variables and their
    control settings.
    Shell Commands: man locale
    
11) downcase-dwim
    downcase-region
    downcase-word
    Emacs Commands: C-h a

12) C-M-r: isearch-backward-regexp: do incremental search backward for regular expression.
    C-M-s: isearch-forward-regexp: do incremental search forward for regular expression.
    C-M-t: transpose-sexps: transpose two balanced expressions.
    C-M-u: backward-up-list: move backward out of one level of parentheses.
    C-M-v: scroll-other-window: scroll next window upward ARG lines (full screen if no ARGS)
    Emacs Commands: C-h b, C-x o, C-v, M-v

13) C-g aborts a command that is partially typed or currently executing. 
    Emacs Commands: C-h r, C-v, M-v

14) The yank function essentially pastes the segment of text that was most
    recently killed. It can easily be invoked using the keystroke C-y. 
    Emacs Commands: C-h r, C-v, M-v

15) The main difference is that the dired command gives us the current and parent directory,
    while ls -l does not.
    Shell Commands: ls -l
    Emacs Commands: C-h b, C-s dired, C-x d
