Homework 7 Questions

1) Even if other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the netwok,
the resulting network would still be secure. This is because all the bytes which
were transferred would have been encrypted with the public key. The private key
would never be publicly available or transferred over the network, thus
eliminating the possibility of another team decrypting the bytes. 

If the teams had been observing our keystrokes they would not be able to discern what
the private keys are; however, they would be able to tell what messages were sent. Thus
even if they did not know what they keys were since they could tell what the actual
message are the network would not be secure. Finally if the teams had obtained the USB
and we were saving all our files to the USB they would be able to obtain our private 
key. The private key is stored in a file and thus the teams obtaining the USB would
cause the network to no longer be secure.

2) It does not verify that you created the file because it only has access to your 
public key and the account name that is associated with it. Thus it cannot actually
verify that the account in question created the public key. One way to fix this is
to encrypt a message using the public key and send it to the account. If the account
is able to use its private key to successfully decrypt the message, then we have 
verified that it indeed created the public key. If the account is unable to decrypt, 
then we know that it did not create the public key.
