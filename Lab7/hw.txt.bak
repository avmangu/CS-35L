Homework 7 Questions

1) Even if other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the netwok,
the resulting network would still be secure. This is because all the bytes which
were transferred would have been encrypted with the public key. The private key
would never be publicly available or transferred over the network, thus
eliminating the possibility of another team decrypting the bytes.If the other
teams had also tapped our keyboards after we completed all client-server setup
and had thereby obtained our team's keystrokes during later operation, then our
network can still be considered secure. This is because after the client-server
setup is completed, there is no need to type any sort of password. Our keys
would have already been generated, and the only typed entries would be commands
to ssh login into the host server. Finally, if we are booting off USB and assume
the other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB, then our network
could again be considered insecure. This is because they would have access to
our private key, which is stored on a file in the .ssh folders. 

2) The gpg2 --verify command in the following instructions doesn't really verify
that you personally created the file in question. This is because it only checks
that the signature is valid and that it matches up with the public key. To fix
this problem, we can use our received public key to encrypt some file, send it
to whoever we are trying to verify, and see if they can use their private key to
decrypt the data. If they cannot decrypt the file, then they clearly didn't
create the file in question.
