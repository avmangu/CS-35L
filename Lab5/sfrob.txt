Homework 5 Performance Comparison: Encrypted Sort Revisited

sfrob vs. sfrobu:

      test1.txt (9 lines):
	sfrob: real	0m0.007s
	       user	0m0.009s
	       sys	0m0.000s
	       
	sfrobu: real	0m0.011s
		user	0m0.013s
		sys	0m0.005s

      test2.txt (62 lines):
	sfrob: real	0m0.027s
	       user	0m0.022s
	       sys	0m0.006s
	       
	sfrobu: real	0m0.072s
		user	0m0.039s
		sys	0m0.034s

      test3.txt (366 lines):
	sfrob: real	0m0.190s
	       user	0m0.087s
	       sys	0m0.043s
	       
	sfrobu: real	0m0.209s
		user	0m0.083s
		sys	0m0.170s

From these results, in the case of all 3 input files, we can clearly
see that sfrob is much faster than sfrobu. To see the number of
comparisons being done, we can simply use the strace command. As a
function of the input lines, the comparisons for sfrob seem to be:
f(i) = i. However, the comparisons as a function of the input in lines
in sfrobu seem to be about: f(i) = 614i. i represents ihe input lines,
while the f(i) represents the number of comparisons. 

sfrob vs sfrobu vs sfrobs vs sfrobu -f vs sfrobs -f:

      test3.txt (366 lines):
	sfrob: real	0m0.190s
	       user	0m0.087s
	       sys	0m0.043s
	       
	sfrobu: real	0m0.209s
		user	0m0.083s
		sys	0m0.170s

	sfrobs: real	0m0.204s
		user	0m0.118s
		sys	0m0.039s

	sfrobu -f: real	0m0.209s
	       	   user	0m0.099s
		   sys	0m0.151s

	sfrobs -f: real	0m0.195s
	       	   user	0m0.141s
		   sys	0m0.021s

From these results, we can see that sfrob is the fastest, by a small
margin over sfrobs -f. Here are the rankings by speed, from fastest
(1), to slowest (5):

1. sfrob
2. sfrobs -f
3. sfrobs
4. sfrobu
5. sfrobu -f

We can also see that sfrobu was clearly the slowest, and using the -f
command for case sensitivity made no real difference, as the
performance times remained essentially identical.
